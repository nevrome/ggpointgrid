# ggpointgrid

This package provides a simple geom (`geom_pointgrid`) derived from geom_point that rearranges the input points for a scatterplot on a regular grid while strictly avoiding overplotting.

### Example

### Installation

You can install the development version from github with the following command (in your R console):

```
if(!require('remotes')) install.packages('remotes')
remotes::install_github("nevrome/ggpointgrid")
```
